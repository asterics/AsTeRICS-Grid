# Introduction
CouchDb is used in combination with PouchDb in order to save user configuration and default grids offline (pouchDb) and online in a auto-sync storage (couchDb).

see: http://couchdb.apache.org/
see: https://pouchdb.com/

# 1 und 1 Ionos Cloud Server
CouchDb currently runs on:
https://couchdb.asterics-foundation.org:6984/
The server behind the asterics-foundation domain is from Ionos 1&1 Cloud solution:
1ce28d.online-server.cloud
or
82.165.247.108

For configuration of the Ionos Cloud server:
1) go to: https://login.ionos.de/ and login
2) Choose "Server and Cloud" -> Cloud panel opens
3) Here root ssh password for the server can be found
4) Go to Network -> Firewall Rules on the left side to open/close ports that are accessible (CouchDb SSL runs on port 6984)

# Installation of couchdb
CouchDB was installed on the Ionos Cloud Server following this manual: http://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/install/unix.html

## Subdomain Configuration
We are using the subdomain couchdb.asterics-foundation.org. For configuration of this domain follow these stepts:
1) go to: https://login.ionos.de/ and login
2) Choose "Domains and SSL" -> "asterics-foundation.org" -> "manage subdomains" -> Here the subdomains can be configured
3) In order to let point "couchdb.asterics-foundation.org" to the cloud server (82.165.247.108) do:
3.1) subdomain "couchdb.asterics-foundation.org" -> Manage DNS
3.2) Add two "A" rules: "couchdb -> 82.165.247.108" and "www.couchdb -> 82.165.247.108"

## SSL Configuration
We are using the SSL certificate provided by 1 und 1 Ionos. To see/download/manage it:
1) go to: https://login.ionos.de/ and login
2) Choose "Domains and SSL" -> "SSL Certificates" on the right side
3) Choose "Cloud" product in combo on the right side and open the certificate for "*.asterics-foundation.org"
3.1) IMPORTANT: The products "Cloud" and "1 & 1 Basic" have different SSL certificates and both can only be used once (for couchdb or for asterics-foundation.org)!
4) Here you can renew/download the certificate which consists of 3 files:
4.1) asterics-foundation.org_private_key.key
4.2) asterics-foundation.org_ssl_certificate.cer
4.3) asterics-foundation.org_ssl_certificate_INTERMEDIATE.cer
5) These 3 files are copied into /opt/couchdb/ssl/ folder on the cloud server
6) The couchdb configuration files "default.ini" and "local.ini" have to be adapted to use the correct ports and certificates -> see "default.ini" and "local.ini" in this folder next to this text file.
7) to reload the certificate stop and start couchdb on the server using the commands "sudo service couchdb stop" and "sudo service couchdb start" afterwards.
8) run "sh /home/superlogin/AsTeRICS-Grid/scripts/start.sh" to restart superlogin
9) do "sudo reboot" in order to also re-init apache tomcat (https://couchdb.asterics-foundation.org/report.html)

Couchdb should now be accessible with SSL enabled under the link:
https://couchdb.asterics-foundation.org:6984/_utils/#login

Used method in order to setup start of superlogin and goaccess:
crontab -e
@reboot /bin/sh /home/superlogin/AsTeRICS-Grid/scripts/start.sh
