# Voices

[Back to Overview](README.md)

AsTeRICS Grid uses voices from these sources:
* **offline:** voices installed on the operating system (differs depending on platform, Windows has different voices than Android or iOS), e.g. `Microsoft David - English, offline` on a Windows computer
* **online:** voices vary by operation system and browser. With some of the online voices (those from from [responsivevoice.org](https://responsivevoice.org/), e.g. `Spanish Female, online`) there can be some delay (e.g. 5 seconds or more) until the label is spoken. There are also random errors accessing the voice service.

In general, **offline voices should be preferred**, because they are most reliable and not depending on an internet connection. Most **problems occur with voices from [responsivevoice.org](https://responsivevoice.org/)**, which is why they only should be used if no alternatives are available. Android tablets offer the best options for a lot of languages.

*Note: Some browsers like Internet Explorer do not support text-to-speech. In these browsers, speak actions will do nothing.*

Here is a breakdown of the options depending on devices:

1. [iPad](11_voices.md#iPad)
2. [Windows Tablets](11_voices.md#windows-tablet)
3. [Android Tablets](11_voices.md#android-tablet)
4. [Amazon Fire Tablets](11_voices.md#amazon-fire-tablet)
5. [Offline Voices per System](11_voices.md#offline-voices-per-system)

## iPad

**Recommended browser:** Firefox

**General Information**
- Online and offline voices provided by Apple are listed in the drop-down menu of voices in AsTeRICS Grid.
- The quality of voices varies.
- Some voices labeled as "male" might not sound deep, possibly due to errors by Apple or because they are recordings of male teens before voice breaking.

**System Voice**
- The current system voice (`Accessibility > Spoken Content > Voice`) is available offline and is generally high quality.
- This voice does not appear in the dropdown but activates when set to `Default device voice, offline`.
- The iPad language must match the system voice language (`General > Language & Region`) for it to function.
- If multiple voices for the language are downloaded, the first voice listed in system settings will be used. Reordering is not possible, so only download the desired voice.

**Multilingual Limitations**
- Out of the system voices, Apple only makes the current system voice available for offline use.
- It is possible to combine one system voice with online/offline voices from the browser but not to multiple system voices.
- Third-party voices cannot be installed on the system.

<!-- With iOS 15 it was possible to use all voices installed on the device within AsTeRICS Grid. With iOS 16 Apple seems to have decided to remove the possibility to use high quality voices within web applications and therefore also to remove them from AsTeRICS Grid. With iOS 17 the situation became better again, now for most languages at least one higher quality voice is available for AsTeRICS Grid.
Due to Apple's ongoing changes to voice availability and the uncertainty surrounding future updates as well as the lack of options to install third-party voices, using an iPad for AsTeRICS Grid is not recommended. -->

## Windows Tablet

**Recommended browser:** Microsoft Edge.

**General Information**
- Microsoft's online and offline voices are listed in the drop-down list of voices in AsTeRICS Grid.
- The quality of offline voices is generally lower than that of the online voices. 
- While Microsoft often offers multiple versions for a language, differentiating by country, the voices do not always reflect the accent or dialect specific to that country!
- Microsoft does not explicitly label child voices. A few voices with female names sound very young. In the following tables, it was only marked if the voice distinctly sounded like a child. That said, several other "female" voices could also be used as child voices. A few of the voices are listed by Microsoft as "male" but don't sound deep. It might be a mistake by Microsoft or possibly a male teen before voice break.

**System voice**
- System voices are available offline.
- To install additional voices go to: `language system settings -> add language -> search for the language you want to install -> if there is a speech balloon icon next to the language it indicates that a text-to-speech (TTS) voice is available for this language -> install it -> restart the device`

**Multilingual Limitations**
- Voices installed through third-party software (e.g., CereProc) don’t appear to work in the browser. There might however be a way to use them, in which case the following tables aren't exhaustive.
- If offline voices by Microsoft are available, it's possible to use the available offline voices together.

## Android Tablet

**Recommended browser:** Firefox.

**General Information**
- Android’s online and offline voices are listed in the drop-down list of voices in AsTeRICS GRID. 
- No voices are listed as offline, although some voices do appear to work offline.

**Installing additional voices**
- Voices purchased from third parties become available in the dropdown and are available offline. Tested with: Acapella, Vocalizer, RHVoice, Google Voices, AhoTTS, and CereProc.
- Set which TTS company to use under `General management > Text-to-speech > Preferred engine`. There might be more voices installable through other third-party software, in which case the following tables aren't exhaustive.

**Multilingual Limitations**
- It does not seem possible to use voices from different TTS companies simultaneously.

- Several languages are labelled as male but sound female, and vice versa. The table reflects how the voices sound rather than their labels.

### Acapela
- Voices are purchased through the acapela app.
- Purchased voices are displayed in the drop-down, as e.g. `lang.spa: Spanish (ESP,Ines), online`. You need to select `show all voices`. Despite being labelled as `online` they are available offline too.
- All downloaded languages can be selected. If a voice is set as system voice it will appear as `Default device voice, offline` in the drop-down.

### Google Voices
- No purchase. Voices must be downloaded in the settings (`Cog wheel > Install voice data`). If multiple voices are available for the same language, changing it in the settings doesn’t seem to impact the voice that is used in the browser. The table shows the voices that are automatically selected.
- The voices are displayed in the drop-down, as e.g. `Khmer (Cambodia), offline`.
- All downloaded languages can be selected. 
- There is sometimes a lag when switching languages
- While it often offers multiple versions for one language, differentiating by country, the voice is most of the time just the same voice.

### AhoTTS
- Offers voices in Spanish and Basque

### CereProc
- Only the system voice seems available as default.
- It doesn’t work with all purchased voices.
=> Not recommended, currently

## Amazon Fire Tablet
### General Information
- The (online) voices for Amazon Fire are the same ones as for Android.

### System voices
- It’s possible to install more voices in the settings of the tablet. The downloaded voices are listed alphabetically, and AsTeRICS Grid seems to simply use the first one on the list, so only download the voice you want to use.
- Despite that option to install voices in the settings, these voices don’t seem to become available offline!
