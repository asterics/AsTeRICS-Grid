## Internet Connection Requirements

Despite being a web-application that runs in an internet browser, AsTeRICS Grid is designed to be usable also without internet connection.

**Internet connection is required for:**

1. First usage of AsTeRICS Grid. Initially opening <a href="https://grid.asterics.eu/" target="_blank">https://grid.asterics.eu/</a> automatically downloads the whole application to browser cache and therefore AsTeRICS Grid is usable offline afterwards.
2. Synchronizing configuration of online users
3. Certain voices

**Without internet access it is possible to:**

1. Use AsTeRICS Grid by just re-opening <a href="https://grid.asterics.eu/" target="_blank">https://grid.asterics.eu/</a> in the browser (only initial access needs internet access).
2. Switch between all saved users, which can be both offline and online users

## Selecting a Device

You can use AsTeRICS Grid on all computers, tablets and mobile phones with Android, iOS, Windows, macOS or Linux.

The primary consideration for selecting a specific hardware is the availability of the voice(s) you intend to use. This will be influenced by the availabiltity of internet connection, as some voices are available online only. For a detailed list of currently available voices, see [chapter 11](11_voices.md).

Other criteria for selecting a particular device could be:
* Price
* The audio output and quality of the built-in speakers
* The size and quality of the touchscreen
* The availability of protective cases/shells, keyguards (if necessary) or mounting solutions
* The availability of a USB port in case an assistive switch should be connected via USB (but there are also switches with a Bluetooth interface)
* The input method, since some input methods need the AsTeRICS Framework (e.g. head tracking, eye-tracking). The AsTeRICS Framework runs on Windows, macOS and Linux, but some hardware only works with Windows.

## Selecting a Browser

AsTeRICS Grid is compatible with all modern browsers, but certain features, particularly some voices, may not work in all of them. For the best multilingual experience, we recommend using the following browsers:

- **iOS**: Firefox
- **Windows**: Microsoft Edge
- **Android**: Firefox

Some special features like hardware access via Bluetooth or serial interface only work in Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Chromium, etc.).

## Installing the App

You can access AsTeRICS Grid by simply opening your browser and navigating to https://grid.asterics.eu/ and you can set a bookmark for quicker access. We however recommend adding a website shortcut to the desktop of the device. This not only provides fast access to AsTeRICS Grid but also helps prevent younger users from accidentally navigating to other sites. It also solves some browser-specific issues like the fullscreen not working in iOS Firefox.

The steps to create a desktop shortcut vary by browser. Here are the steps for some browsers:

### iOS

#### Firefox (iOS)
1. Go to the menu (three lines next to the website address)
2. Select `Share`
3. Select `Add to Home Screen`
4. Set the name you want the shortcut to have

#### Chrome, Safari (iOS)
1. Go to the `share` button next to the website adress (a square with an arrow pointing outward)
2. Select `Add to Home Screen`
3. Set the name you want the shortcut to have

### Android

#### Chrome, Firefox (Android)
1. Go to the menu (three dots)
2. Select `Add to Home Screen`
3. Click `Install` or `Add` in the popup

### Windows

#### Chrome (Windows)
1. Click on the `install` button next to the website address (computer screen with arrow pointing inward)
2. Click on the `Install` button in the popup

#### Microsoft Edge (Windows)
1. Click on the `install` button next to the website address (there squares and a **+**)
2. Click on the `Install` button in the popup

#### Firefox (Windows)
Firefox intentionally does not support to "installing" web-applications on Desktop since december 2020, see [this bugreport](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1682593). However, you can still use AsTeRICS Grid within Firefox without installing it.
