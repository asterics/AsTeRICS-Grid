# Internationalization

There are two aspects of internationalization in AsTeRICS Grid:
* Translation of contents, also see [Translate the content](../documentation_user/contributing-to-ag.md#translate-the-content) and [Multilingual grid sets](../documentation_user/12_multilingual-grid-sets.md) in the user docs.
* Translation of the app (e.g. menu and button labels), also see [Translate the application](../documentation_user/contributing-to-ag.md#translate-the-application) in the user docs

This developer documentation explains the technical background of both forms of translations.

## Translation of contents

The data model of Grid and GridElement (see [Data model](./05_datamodel.md)) have a `label` property which contains an object as a map of translated labels. For instance:

```
{
  "en-us": "Fries",
  "en-gb": "Chips",
  "de": "Pommes",
  "es": "Patatas fritas"
}
```

The key is the [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1) language code which can be combined with [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO-3166-1-Kodierliste) codes for localization of the languages. Possible combinations are predefined, see [variable "allLangCodes" in i18nService.js](https://github.com/asterics/AsTeRICS-Grid/blob/master/src/js/service/i18nService.js#L44).

The modal component [gridTranslateModal.vue](https://github.com/asterics/AsTeRICS-Grid/blob/master/src/vue-components/modals/gridTranslateModal.vue) allows to define these translations of element labels.

The [property "lang" for word forms](https://github.com/asterics/AsTeRICS-Grid/blob/master/src/js/model/WordForm.js#L4) also contains the same `ISO 639-1` / `ISO 3166-1 alpha-2` language codes as described above and defines the language for a specific word form. Word forms are set up in [editElementWordForms.vue](https://github.com/asterics/AsTeRICS-Grid/blob/master/src/vue-components/modals/editElementWordForms.vue).

## Translation of the app

All app translations are located in folder [app/lang](https://github.com/asterics/AsTeRICS-Grid/tree/master/app/lang). This folder contains a file for each language where app translations are existing. Important infos:
* the translations are managed by [crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/asterics-grid)
* the source of the translations are the [English translations in i18n.en.json](https://github.com/asterics/AsTeRICS-Grid/blob/master/app/lang/i18n.en.json), all other translations files should not be altered manually
* Workflow:
   * change / add English translation in `i18n.en.json`
   * push changes to `master` branch on GitHub
   * wait for crowdin so sync with `master` or manually sync in crowdin at `Integrations -> GitHub -> Sync Now`
   * translate to other languages in the [crowdin dashboard](https://crowdin.com/project/asterics-grid)
   * crowdin creates a pull-request on GitHub from branch `l10n_master` which can be merged to `master`
* theoretically also localized languages are possible as app languages, crowdin is configured to use the `%osx_locale%` placeholder for filenames. Reason: little changes to existing file names when set up. This can be changed at crowdin: `Integrations -> GitHub -> Edit -> Edit (pencil)`
* App languages that can be used in the app are defined in [i18nService.js](https://github.com/asterics/AsTeRICS-Grid/blob/master/src/js/service/i18nService.js#L17). Currently this doesn't include localized languages, maybe needs some adaptions in order to integrate them.

## Translations in code

There are several possibilities to get translations while coding.

### Get app language translations

In Vue templates it's possible to simply use the function `$t()` of the used [vue-i18n](https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/) plugin:
* `$t('someKey')` retrieves the translation if it's defined like `"someKey": "my translation"` in `i18n.en.json`
* `$t('someKey', {paramKey: "some param"})` retrieves a translation defined like `"someKey": "my translation with {paramKey}"` in `i18n.en.json`

It's also possible to use `i18nService.t()` the same way outside a Vue context.

### Get content language translations

For retrieving content language translations in code, you can use `i18nService.getTranslation()`. It takes a key/value object as described in [translation of contents](#translation-of-contents) above and returns the translation in the current `content language` set in the application. So `i18nService.getTranslation(gridElement.label)` returns the current label of a grid element.
