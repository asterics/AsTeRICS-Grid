## Project structure
The AsTeRICS Grid project is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/asterics/AsTeRICS-Grid). These are the main folders and files in the project:

* **app/**: folder containing static and built resources for the actual AsTeRICS Grid application. Host this folder in addition to `../index.html` in the root folder on webserver in order to and open the `../index.html` file in order to start AsTeRICS Grid.
* **docs/**: folder containing various documentation resources, e.g. this manual 
* **scripts/**: folder containing shell scripts, e.g. for releasing a new AsTeRICS Grid release
* **src/**: folder containing Javascript sources 
* **superlogin/**: folder containing configuration of [couch-auth](https://github.com/perfood/couch-auth) (former superlogin), a library that handles users and databases for [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/), the database backend used by AsTeRICS Grid.

* **CNAME**: configuration file of GitHub, specifying which alternative domain points to the version that is found on the GitHub [gh-pages branch](https://github.com/asterics/AsTeRICS-Grid/tree/gh-pages). The version on this branch is the version that is delivered when opening [https://grid.asterics.eu/](https://grid.asterics.eu/).

* **README.md**: markdown readme file for the GitHub project page 
* **serviceWorker.js**: [Service Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) that manages offline capabilities of AsTeRICS Grid using [Workbox](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/workbox)
* **unsupported.html**: static HTML file that is shown if AsTeRICS Grid is opened with an unsupported browser
* **webpack.config.js**: [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) configuration file specifying options for building and bundling the application

* **build/**: folder containing a built and minified file of all sources that are included in the `src/` folder. For bundling [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) is used.
