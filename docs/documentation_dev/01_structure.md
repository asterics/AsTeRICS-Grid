This chapter is about the general structure of the AsTeRICS Grid project:

1. [Sources structure](01_structure.md#sources-structure)

[Back to Overview](README.md)

## Project structure
The AsTeRICS Grid project is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/asterics/AsTeRICS-Grid). These are the main folders and files in the project:

* **app/**: folder containing static and built resources for the actual AsTeRICS Grid application. Host this folder in addition to `../index.html` in the root folder on webserver in order to and open the `../index.html` file in order to start AsTeRICS Grid.
* **docs/**: folder containing various documentation resources, e.g. this manual 
* **scripts/**: folder containing shell scripts, e.g. for releasing a new AsTeRICS Grid release
* **src/**: folder containing Javascript sources 
* **superlogin/**: folder containing configuration of [superlogin](https://github.com/sen-su/superlogin), a tool that handles users and databases for [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/), the database backend used by AsTeRICS Grid.
* **.babelrc**: configuration for [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) Javascript compiler, only needed for running [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) tests, other Babel configuration is found in `webpack.config.js`
* **.gitignore**: file specifying which files to ignore by [Git](https://git-scm.com/) version control
* **CNAME**: configuration file of GitHub, specifying which alternative domain points to the version that is found on the GitHub [gh-pages branch](https://github.com/asterics/AsTeRICS-Grid/tree/gh-pages). Therefore the version found on this branch is the version that is delivered when opening [https://grid.asterics.eu/](https://grid.asterics.eu/).
* **index.html**: entry point of the application, uses resources from the `app/` folder
* **LICENSE**: file specifying the license of AsTeRICS Grid which is [AGPL3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.de.html).
* **README.md**: markdown readme file for the GitHub project page 
* **package.json**: [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) configuration file specifying dependencies and scripts for the AsTeRICS Grid project
* **package-lock.json**: file generated by [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) specifying the exact version of dependencies used in the project
* **webpack.config.js**: [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) configuration file specifying options for building and bundling the application

## Sources structure
All custom sources are located in the `src` folder which has the following structure:

* **css/**: includes custom stylesheets
* **js/**: all pure Javascript sources
    * **externals/**: folder including ES6 module wrapppers of libraries that are included externally within a `<script>` tag in `index.html`. Wrapper is needed in order to make the libraries test- and mockable with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).
    * **input/**: folder containing modules implementing various input options like hovering or scanning 
    * **model/**: definitions of data model classes using [ObjectModel](https://objectmodel.js.org/)
    * **service/**: all kind of modules providing a functionality that is related to AsTeRICS Grid's functionality, access the database or performing actions
    * **util/**: all modules providing any general functionality that is needed by other modules or services 
    * **vue/**: all [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) related modules, not including vue components
    * **mainScript.js**: starting point of the whole application 
    * **router.js**: module that does routing to different views based on the current hash of the URL, e.g. `#main`, `#login` or `#grids`. Uses the [Navigo](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo) library.
* **vue-components/**: folder containing all [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) components
    * **components/**: folder for general purpose components
    * **modals/**: folder for modal (popup) components
    * **views/**: folder for view components, see all kinds of views in the [user documentation](../documentation_user/02_navigation.md#navigation-and-basic-functionality)

### Elements in folder "app/"

Besides the custom sources in the `src/` folder the `app/` folder contains these elements which in total realize the working AsTeRICS Grid application:
* **build/**: folder containing a built and minified file of all sources that are included in the `src/` folder. For bundling [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) is used.
* **css/**: global stylesheets which are directly included `index.html`. There is no specific reason for not putting them into `src/css/` and let them also be bundled with webpack to the bundle in `build/`. 
* **dictionaries/**: [lz-string](http://pieroxy.net/blog/pages/lz-string/index.html) compressed [predictionary](https://github.com/asterics/predictionary) dictionaries including the most frequently used words of different languages. The dictionary fitting the user's language preferences is automatically imported on creating a new user and visible in the [manage dictionaries view](../documentation_user/02_navigation.md#manage-dictionaries-view).
* **examples/**: folder containing example grid-sets. The gridset `default_[language_code].grd` is automatically imported on creating a new user.
* **img/**: folder containing images and icons
* **lib/**: folder containing various javascript libraries, which are not imported using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). 
* **polyfill/**: folder containing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyfill_(programming)">polyfills</a> which are used in order to bring newer language features to older browsers
* **simple/**: folder containing a simple version of AsTeRICS Grid which only shows simple buttons which can trigger ARE actions defined in a gridset (`.grd`) file.
* **index.html**: starting point of the application, basic html including all bundled javascript resources and libraries.
* **manifest.appcache**: [AppCache](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTML/Using_the_application_cache) manifest file including all resources to cache for offline usage
* **manifest.webmanifest**: [Web App Manifest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest) file containing information about the app and making it usable as progressive web app, e.g. using and installing it in an app-like fashion on smartphones.
