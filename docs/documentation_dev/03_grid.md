# Grid layout
This chapter is about the technical background of the dynamic grid system which visualizes grids and grid elements in AsTeRICS Grid.

The implementation using the [GridList library](https://github.com/klues/grid) was replaced by [vue-css-grid-layout](https://github.com/asterics/vue-css-grid-layout), see [issue #451](https://github.com/asterics/AsTeRICS-Grid/issues/451).

For convenience reasons `vue-css-grid-layout` is developed directly within AsTeRICS Grid in folder `src/vue-components/grid-layout`, the [vue-css-grid-layout](https://github.com/asterics/vue-css-grid-layout) contains a copy in order to be usable as standalone library in other projects.

See [detailed docs](https://github.com/asterics/vue-css-grid-layout?tab=readme-ov-file#api) in the Readme vue-css-grid-layout repository.
