# Collaboration

This document contains info about for collaborating in the development or operation of AsTeRICS Grid.
There are two sections, the first for everyone, the second for people within our organization who have access to internal
services.

## General info
* we're using [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) as code formatter, see [config file for Prettier](https://github.com/asterics/AsTeRICS-Grid/blob/master/.prettierrc) the [PR that introduces it](https://github.com/asterics/AsTeRICS-Grid/pull/246). So if you're planning to contribute at coding level, please configure your IDE to use Prettier.

## Public collaboration
### Working on issues
We're trying to label issues that are maybe suitable for starting coding with [Good first issue](https://github.com/asterics/AsTeRICS-Grid/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22). Use it to find issues where you want to start collaborating.

Please do the following things if you want to work on an issue:
* Check if the issue is already assigned to another person on Github. If yes, contact the person and ask if he/she is still working on it or if you could start working on the issue.
* Assign yourself to the issue. If you don't have the right to do it:
   * write to office@asterics-foundation.org and ask to be added as collaborator to the project on Github
   * as an alternative fork the project on Github, leave a comment that you're working on the issue and start to work on it in your fork.
* create a new branch for your issue (if not working on your own fork). The branch name should be `#[issuenumber]/short-description-of-issue`
* after finishing working on the issue, create a PR for merging it to the `master` branch
