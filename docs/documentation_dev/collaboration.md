# Collaboration

This document contains info about for collaborating in the development or operation of AsTeRICS Grid.
There are two sections, the first for everyone, the second for people within our organization who have access to internal
services.

## General info
* we're using [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) as code formatter, see [config file for Prettier](https://github.com/asterics/AsTeRICS-Grid/blob/master/.prettierrc) the [PR that introduces it](https://github.com/asterics/AsTeRICS-Grid/pull/246). So if you're planning to contribute at coding level, please configure your IDE to use Prettier.

## Public collaboration
### Working on issues
We're trying to label issues that are maybe suitable for starting coding with [Good first issue](https://github.com/asterics/AsTeRICS-Grid/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22). Use it to find issues where you want to start collaborating.

Please do the following things if you want to work on an issue:
* Check if the issue is already assigned to another person on Github. If yes, contact the person and ask if he/she is still working on it or if you could start working on the issue.
* Assign yourself to the issue. If you don't have the right to do it:
   * write to office@asterics-foundation.org and ask to be added as collaborator to the project on Github
   * as an alternative fork the project on Github, leave a comment that you're working on the issue and start to work on it in your fork.
* switch to git branch `master` and update `git checkout master && git pull`
* create a new branch for your issue (if not working on your own fork). The branch name should be something like `issue#<issue-number>/short-description-of-issue`
* after finishing working on the issue, create a PR for merging it to the `master` branch

### Review and test open PR's
You're welcome to test open PR's and add your comments or code reviews.

### Working on translations
Please see [Translation of AsTeRICS Grid](../documentation_user/contributing-to-ag.md#translate-the-application) for information how to contribute translations of the application or the content.

## Internal collaboration
This section is for people who have access to our email address and servers.

### Responding to email requests
For emails regarding AsTeRICS Grid received at `office@asterics-foundation.org` the general rule is:
* We answer all non-spanish requests
* Spanish requests are redirected to the social media platforms that are maintained by ARASAAC. Use this mail to respond to Spanish requests:

```

We're also trying to create a community around AsTeRICS Grid on Github discussions: https://github.com/asterics/AsTeRICS-Grid/discussions
If you want to register on Github and you think your question (and it's answer) could be usable for other people, please consider posting your question there.

Thanks and best regards,

In general try to point people with requests to Github discussions, by adding a line like this at the end of your response:
